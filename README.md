# ScriptEcho

Welcome to ScriptEcho, an AI-powered platform designed to revolutionize the creative workflow for influencers and content creators. Our mission is to streamline the content creation process, from initial idea to final audio, allowing creators to focus on what they do best: creating.

## Core Idea

ScriptEcho empowers creators by providing a seamless, two-step process for content generation:

1.  **AI Script Generation:** Users can input a title, platform, target audience, and other details to generate high-quality, engaging scripts tailored to their specific needs.
2.  **AI Voice-Overs:** Once a script is finalized, creators can instantly generate a realistic AI voice-over, transforming the text into ready-to-use audio.

This project is currently in **Beta**.
